All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a `prototype`. Also, an objectâ€™s `prototype` itself is an object.
```js
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

typeof Bird.prototype; // => object
```
Because a prototype is an `object`, a `prototype` can have its own `prototype`! In this case, the `prototype` of `Bird.prototype` is `Object.prototype`:

```js
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);
// returns true
```

How is this useful? You may recall the `hasOwnProperty` method from a previous challenge:

```js
let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.hasOwnProperty("name"); // => true
```
The `hasOwnProperty` method is defined in `Object.prototype`, which can be accessed by `Bird.prototype`, which can then be accessed by `duck`. This is an example of the **prototype chain**. In this `prototype chain`, `Bird` is the `supertype` for `duck`, while `duck` is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.
