# BootStrap

## col-*-*
Take for example Bootstrap's `col-md-*` class. Here, md means **medium**, and `*` is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use `col-xs-*`, where xs means **extra small** (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and `*` is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.
